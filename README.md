# Homework 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## My Task

The purpose of this project was to refactor, or edit, the existing code provided for the client's site to make it more accessible, without changing the functionality of the code itself. 

This is achieved through several means:
 1. By finding code that has already been provided that can be changed to more useful code, such as replacing non-semantic elements such as div with semantic elements such header. These semantic elements describe the meaning of the tag to both the browser and the developer. 
 2. By adding accessibility characteristics to the code that ensure people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies, such as adding alt tags to images. 
 3. By consolidating repeating code, specifically in the Cascading Style Sheet, to eliminate unneccessary redundancy. 

 As you will see from the screenshots below, the appearance of the website has not been affected by these changes:
